# Mathematical Statements Application

## Author: Katrina Hill

## Description
This is an application that interacts with users to evaluate logical operations on given inputs and generates truth tables, with a goal of reinforcing the understanding of conjunction, disjunction, negation, implication, and biconditional statements through practical implementation.

## Features
- Convert numbers between base 2, base 8, base 10, and base 16.
- Handles error cases for invalid inputs.
- Comprehensive test suite to ensure the accuracy of conversions.

## Files
- `app.py`: The main program that performs the base conversions.
- `tests.py`: A suite of tests for validating the functionality of the logical operations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository** (or download the files):
   - git clone https://github.com/katrina-l-hill/num_converter.git
   - cd into the repository directory
2. **Run the Main program**:
   - run python num_Converter.py to run the program
3. **Run the tests**:
   - run python -m pytest test_cases.py to run the tests
